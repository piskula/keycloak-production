# Keycloak + PostgreSQL + Nginx + Certbot in a Docker Compose Stack

## Introduction

This project sets up a secure Keycloak server using PostgreSQL as the database, Nginx as a reverse proxy, and Certbot for SSL certificates, all managed through Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **VM on GCP** (or any cloud provider): Make sure itâ€™s configured and running with open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
- **A valid domain name**: Ensure the domain is correctly pointing to your server's IP address.
- **Docker Engine**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piskula/keycloak-production.git
cd keycloak-production
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the provided `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables to fit your setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
```bash
cp cloudflare.ini.example cloudflare.ini
```

Update the following in the `.env` file:
- `KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN`: Your valid domain name.
- `CERTBOT_LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`: Your email address for SSL certificate registration.
- `POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD`: Change default DB password (consider also changing user).

Update the following in the `cloudflare.ini` file:
- `dns_cloudflare_api_token`: Your API token from cloudflare.

### 3. SSL Setup (Run First)

Before starting the main stack, set up SSL certificates for your domain:

1. Make sure your domain is properly configured and pointing to your server.
2. Ensure ports **80** and **443** are open.
3. Run the SSL setup using Certbot and wait for certificates resolution

```bash
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-ssl.yml up
```

### 4. Start the Main Stack

With SSL certificates in place, start the entire stack:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

This will launch Keycloak, PostgreSQL, and Nginx, all configured to use SSL.

### 5. Set Up Automatic Certificate Renewal

To keep your SSL certificates updated, configure `crontab` to renew them automatically every 12 hours:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following entry to run the renewal command:

```bash
0 */12 * * * docker compose run --rm certbot
```

## Port-Forward
We often need to be able to reach into our VM through port-forward. When configuring e.g. with Putty, you need to
specify source and destination in following way
- `source` is address on your local machine
- `destination` is address on VM

in Putty forwarding port 5432 inside VM to 5433 on our machine will look like:
`L5433 (source) - localhost:5432 (VM)`

## Keycloak Admin Information

- Default admin username: `admin`
- Default admin password: `admin`

These can be changed in the `.env` file under `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN` and `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## Configuration

All configuration is managed through environment variables in the `.env` file:

| **Variable**                | **Description**                        | **Default Value** | **Required** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| `KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN`           | Domain for the Keycloak server         |                   | Yes          |
| `CERTBOT_LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` | Email for Let's Encrypt registration   |                   | Yes          |
| `SUBNET`                    | Subnet for container network           | 172.16.0.0/29     | No           |
| `KEYCLOAK_VERSION`          | Keycloak image version                 | latest            | No           |
| `POSTGRES_VERSION`          | PostgreSQL image version               | latest            | No           |
| `POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD`      | Password for Keycloak PostgreSQL user  | defaultDbPassword | **No !!!**   |
| `NGINX_VERSION`             | Nginx image version                    | latest            | No           |
| `CERTBOT_VERSION`           | Certbot image version                  | latest            | No           |
